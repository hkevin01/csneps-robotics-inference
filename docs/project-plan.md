# CSNePS Robotics Inference - Project Plan

## Project Overview

The **CSNePS Robotics Inference** project integrates probabilistic perception and planning outputs with symbolic knowledge and natural-deduction/subsumption reasoning using CSNePS (Clojure implementation of SNePS 3). This system provides explainable AI decisions for robotics, computer vision, GNC (Guidance, Navigation, and Control), and medical imaging applications.

### Core Objectives

- **Knowledge-Driven Reasoning**: Fuse noisy sensor data with symbolic knowledge for robust decision-making
- **Explainable AI**: Provide justification trails and proof trees for all inferences
- **Multi-Domain Integration**: Support robotics/SLAM, medical imaging, GNC, and computer vision domains
- **Real-time Processing**: Handle streaming sensor data with concurrent reasoning capabilities
- **Cross-Modal Grounding**: Bridge probabilistic and symbolic reasoning paradigms
